Current Issues:

The PluginManager doesn't properly work.
It should collect all entrys for the hashmap and returns the collection of all entries.
Instead it returns only the latest entry.
Temporary solution:
Put the full list into the first feature (In_Console) and remove the PluginList from the other features.
This way the program works, as long as only currently implemented features are selected.
If an non-implemented feature is choosen the "somethign went wrong" mesage is shown.
